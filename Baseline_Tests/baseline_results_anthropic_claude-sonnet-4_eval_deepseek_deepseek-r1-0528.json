Is it:\n- Technical aspects like harmony or structure?\n- Getting ideas from your head into reality?\n- Comparing your work to others?\n- Something else entirely?\n\nMany successful composers have felt exactly what you're describing. Brahms destroyed many of his early works and took decades to feel confident enough to publish his first symphony. Even experienced composers regularly face creative blocks and self-doubt.\n\nRemember that composing is a skill that develops over time, not a talent you either have or don't have.

It sounds like you might be feeling a bit overwhelmed, which is completely normal when starting something new.\n\nMusic composition can be approached in many ways, depending on your background and goals:\n\n**If you're a complete beginner:**\n- Start simple - even humming a melody counts as composing\n- Use free apps like GarageBand or online tools\n- Try building on familiar chord progressions (like C-G-Am-F)\n\n**If you have some musical experience:**\n- Begin with a simple structure (verse-chorus-verse)\n- Pick an instrument you're comfortable with\n- Start with melody or chord progression - whichever feels natural\n\n**Basic steps to try:**\n1. Choose a mood or feeling you want to express\n2. Hum or play around until something sounds good\n3. Record it (even on your phone)\n4. Build on that idea gradually\n\nCould you tell me more about your situation? Do you play any instruments? Are you working on this for a class, personal interest, or something else?

You're dealing with different tastes, moods, attention spans, and preferences all at once - that's genuinely challenging.\n\nWhat's making you feel like you can't do this? Is it:\n- Too many conflicting opinions to balance?\n- Pressure to pick something everyone will love?\n- Past experiences where your choices didn't go over well?\n- Feeling overwhelmed by all the options?\n\nHere's the thing: there's rarely a \"perfect\" choice that will thrill everyone. Most successful group movie nights aim for \"good enough that everyone can enjoy it\" rather than \"everyone's absolute favorite.\"\n\nYou don't have to be the sole decision-maker either. What if you:\n- Narrowed it down to 2-3 options and let the group vote?\n- Asked each person to suggest one movie and picked randomly?\n- Chose a crowd-pleaser genre (like comedy or action) and went from there?\n\nYou're more capable than you think.
